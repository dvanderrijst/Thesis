In this folder, you can find the plots used for the 3D plots in the report. These plots are done with the following setting : 

Model: ARP 2 component model
m=1
N=12
T=mN=12
n=2
q=6
lengthOmega=100
d=5
CR_average_i=[50.0, 50.0]
PR_average_i=[10.0, 10.0]
alpha=[6.0, 12.0]
beta=[2.0, 2.0]
delta=0.2

Outputs for t = 9 - 12 
file1 contains the natural output for ARP policy 
file2 contains the natural output for ARP policy where all outer actions are put to zero. 
file3 contains the new output for ARP policy with warm start, the manipulated Roby.markov chain. 
file4 contains the final out for ARP policy, where file1 and file3 are combined. 


l_1 = i_1
l_2 = i_2
