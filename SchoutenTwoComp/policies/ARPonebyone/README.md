In this folder, you find the results and .dat files used for the policy plots of ARP where we manipulated values one by one. 

The following settings are used:
m=1
N=12
T=mN=12
d=5
CR_average_i=[50.0, 50.0]
PR_average_i=[10.0, 10.0]
alpha=[6.0, 12.0]
beta=[2.0, 2.0]
delta=0.2
The class ModelARP_2Comp is used.

With these settings, two sort of results are obtained. 
1. Pure policies, which are the actions obtained without Roby.markov manipulation
2. All policies, which are the actions obtained using Roby.markov manipulaition and therefor also the actions for transient states are found.
